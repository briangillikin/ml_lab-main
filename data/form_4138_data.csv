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

I'M NOT SURE WHY MY DBQS WERE IMPROPERLY DOCUMENTED UPON SUBMISSION, BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT THEY WERE ALL THOROUGHLY AND ACCURATELY COMPLETED AND ARE SUFFICIENT FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES.

JOHN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ACUTE ANXIETY REACTION 03/02/1971. THIS DIAGNOSIS WAS RENDERED DURING JOHN'S DISCHARGE EXAM FROM THE MARINES AFTER HE SERVED HIS TOUR IN VIETNAM. PTSD HAS BEEN CALLED MANY DIFFERENT NAMES OVER THE YEARS, SUCH AS, COMBAT DISORDER, COMBAT FATIGUE, BATTLE FATIGUE, COMBAT NEUROSIS, COMPLETE EXHAUSTION, OPERATIONAL EXHAUSTION AND SHELL SHOCK. PTSD IS AN ANXIETY DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS TRAUMATIC EVENTS AND CHARACTERIZED BY SUCH SYMPTOMS AS SURVIVOR GUILT, RELIVING THE TRAUMA IN DREAMS, NUMBNESS AND LACK OF INVOLVEMENT WITH REALITY, OR RECURRENT THOUGHTS AND IMAGES. JOHN SUFFERED FROM THESE EXACT SYMPTOMS BECAUSE OF HIS SERVICE DURING THE VIETNAM WAR AND LCDR DOE ACKNOWLEDGED AND CONFIRMED IT IN THAT DISCHARGE EXAM IN 1971. JOHN CONTENDS IT IS OBVIOUSLY A CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE ERROR THAT THIS SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS BY LCDR DOE WAS NEVER MENTIONED IN ANY OF JOHN'S RATING DECISIONS, STATEMENTS OF THE CASE, AND BVA DECISIONS REGARDING PTSD.
